# Formula_principles_of_physics
 The code contains Python implementations of various physics formulas. Each formula is defined as a function and accompanied by a short description comment. The formulas cover topics such as motion, electricity, magnetism, energy, and wave phenomena. Random values are generated to demonstrate the usage of the formulas.
